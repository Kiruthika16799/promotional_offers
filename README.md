promotional offers
# Task :
Create a simple application using PHP script where we need to manage promotional offers for each product.
Admin users should have control to offer start date, end date, start time, end time and discount percentage.
The end user can see the discounted price based on percentage defined for each product and determine
whether the offer is currently active based on the current date and time.
# Note:Â Please hardcode the products and products can be list view or grid view.
